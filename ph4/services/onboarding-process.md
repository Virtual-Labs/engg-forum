# Virtual Labs Onboarding Process

## Introduction

Virtual Labs is a mission-driven project under the Ministry of Education (MoE) that aims to provide laboratory learning experiences to students who lack adequate lab infrastructure. With over 150 labs developed by various consortium institutes, the project follows a streamlined software development life cycle to ensure the delivery of high-quality labs. This document outlines the onboarding process for developers involved in the Virtual Labs project.

## Purpose

This document details the process for onboarding lab developers requesting to host their labs on the central cloud. It specifies the steps required for successful onboarding.

## Audience

The intended audience for this document includes all lab developers and owners who are interested in developing new experiments.

## Definitions

### Onboarding
Onboarding initiates the software development process for an approved lab, with the Central Platform Engineering (CPE) team responsible for creating a Git repository for each experiment.

### GitHub Handle
A GitHub handle is a unique identifier associated with a userâ€™s public (and sometimes private) activities on GitHub.

## Onboarding

### Prerequisites

Before beginning the onboarding process, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. An approved lab proposal in PDF format - [reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yjLMM96kxYnQ4_DiDOwFhdqLG0--0Z1P/view?usp=drive_link).
2. A primary GitHub handle - This can be a university-affiliated GitHub account.
3. A secondary GitHub handle - This should be the primary account used by the contributing developers.

### Onboarding Process

**Step 1:**  
Raise an [issue](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Phase-3%2C+create+experiment+repos&template=experiment-repository-creation-request.md&title=Experiment+Repository+Creation+Request+for+%3Cfill+the+lab+name+here%3E) to request the creation of experiment repositories for the lab.

**Step 2:**  
Provide the required information in the issue and attach the lab proposal [sample](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/files/5985232/Java.Proposal.pdf).

**Step 3:**  
The CPE team at IIITH will create experiment repositories for each experiment listed in the proposal on GitHub. The links to the repositories will be shared in the same issue thread. [sample](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/673#issuecomment-779564300). Once this process is complete, developers will be notified.

**Step 4:**  
Developers are responsible for populating the development branches of these repositories with the source code for the experiments.

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the onboarding process. Upon completing these four steps, developers can proceed to the development phase.

## FAQ

**Can I change the Primary and Secondary GitHub Handle after submitting the experiment repository creation request?**

Yes, the primary GitHub handle can be changed. However, it is recommended to maintain a consistent university-specific handle for Virtual Labs development. Secondary handles are flexible and can be updated as needed.
