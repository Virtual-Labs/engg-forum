# Experiment Repository Creation Process

## Creating a Experiment Repository on GitHub

## Introduction
[Github](https://github.com/) is a web-based git platform that allows developers from different [institutes](https://www.vlab.co.in/participating-institutes) to store and collaborate on [experiment code repositories](https://github.com/orgs/virtual-labs/repositories). An experiment repository is a collection of files and folders that contain code and project files of the experiment. In this guide, we will go through the process of creating a experiment repository.

## Prerequisites
Before we start, you will need a Github account and access to [Virtual Labs](https://www.vlab.co.in/) Github [Organisation](https://github.com/virtual-labs).

## Steps to Create a Experiment Repository

### Step 1: Log in to Github
Go to the Github website and log in to your account.

### Step 2: Create a New Repository
To create a new repository, click on the '+' icon in the top right corner of the Github website. Select ['New Repository'](https://github.com/new) from the dropdown menu.

### Step 3: Set up the Repository
In the 'Create a new repository' page, you will need to enter the following information:

#### Repository Template
Click on the 'template' dropdown menu and select 'virtual-labs/ph3-exp-template' template from the menu.

#### Repository Name
Enter a name for the experiment repository. Make sure the name is descriptive, follows repo name rules, and easy to remember.

##### a) Repository name rules
- Experiment repository name should start with 'exp'
- Second part of the repository name is the name of the experiment
- Last part would be the institute name
- The repository name should not have capital letters or symbols. Only AlphaNumeric.
> Example: Creation of Bubble Sort experiment repository for IIITH </br>
> exp-bubble-sort-iiith

#### Description
Enter the lab name and full name of the experiment in the repository description. This will help developers and other users to understand about the repository.
> Example: This experiment belongs to Data Structures 1 IIITH. Full Name: Bubble Sort

#### Public or Private
Choose whether you want your repository to be public or private. Public repositories can be accessed by anyone, while private repositories can only be accessed by you and collaborators you specify. We need to create public repository for an experiment. 

### Step 4: Create the Repository
Once you have entered all the necessary information, click the 'Create Repository' button at the bottom of the page. Congratulations! You have just created an experiment repository.
