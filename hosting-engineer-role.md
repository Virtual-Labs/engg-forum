## Introduction
  Virtual Labs is a mission mode project initiated by the
  Ministry of Human Resources and Development (MHRD). The
  objective of this project is to provide laboratory
  learning experience to the students who do not have access
  to adequate laboratory infrastructure. Currently there are
  around 90 labs developed by various institutes in the
  consortium.  A streamlined software development life cycle
  process followed for the development of these labs ensures
  high quality labs. This document defines various
  duties to be followed by the hosting engineer of the 
  Virtual Labs project.

## Purpose
  This document defines defines various duties that should 
  be followed by the hosting engineers of the Virtal Labs while
  hosting lab and experiments to virtual-lab organization 
  servers. The roles and responsibilities of the various 
  parties involved in the hosting process is discussed in
  detailed in the document.
  
## Motivation
   Hosting the lab and experiment to virtual-labs organization
   servers will help users to access the labs and experiments
   easily and serculy.
   
## Audience
  The target audience for this document is the hosting team
  at CPE, and IIITH.

## General Responsibilities and processes
 General responsibilities include understaing of On-Boarding process, creation of Experiment Repositories, and watching github engineers forum for requests.
### On-Boarding process of hosting unit 
   - Each hosting unit that needs to be hosted by the Virtual Labs hosting team, must follow an onboarding process. The repository owner of the hosting unit will need to raise an  issue of type '[on-boarding request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/)' in the engineers-forum. The issue will need to filled with the  following pieces of information :
  
   <b>On-Boarding Request</b> - 

  1. A non-conflicting name for the hosting unit. </br>
  2. Repository URL for the hosting unit.</br>
  3. A designated repository owner with the following details: </br>
     a. Repository owner github id</br>
     b. Repository owner email address </br>
  4. The build command for the hosting unit along with the </br>
     link to the build process documentation. </br>
  5. Hardware specification including: </br>
     a. CPU </br>
     b. Memory</br>
     c. Network bandwidth</br>
  6. Software environment specification including:</br>
     a. Host operating system with minimum compatible version</br>
     b. Any additional software packages with minimum compatile versions</br>
     c. Browser plugins required to view experiment</br>
     d. DB</br>
  
  Repository owner will be reponsible for keeping the above information current and intimating the hosting team of any updates/changes as and when needed.
   
  On receipt of an onboarding request the hosting team will verify the data and acknowledge the same as part of the request. 

  The hosting team will be responsible for storing the this information at a central location and making it available for all stakeholders.
 
### Hosting Process of hosting unit
   A repository owner/developer (requester ) will have to
   raise an issue of type '[hosting request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose)' in the GitHub repository [engineers-forum](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum) under Virtual-Labs organisation for hosting of a hosting unit. The issue will need to filled with the following pieces of information:
  
   1. Repository URL
   2. Branch to be deployed
   3. Tag to be deployed
   4. Contact email address and github handle to be used in
      cases of clarifications
   
   A hosting request will be tied to this information. This issue will be a single source of truth for that hosting request.  All communication related to the hosting will be recorded on the raised hosting request.

### Lifecycle of a Hosting Request
    
   - The hosting request will go through the following lifecycle:

   1.  Requester will raise a hosting request issue by duly filling in the details in the '[hosting request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose)'.
   2.  The hosting team will attach the url of the corresponding onboarding request to the hosting request. If the onboarding request is not found ( by searching on the repo url), then the hosting team will add its findings and label the issue as *Failed*.
   3.  If requester is not the repository owner, the hosting team will seek approval from the repository owner. This will be through the above created GitHub hosting request issue.
   4.  The hosting team will honour the hosting request only on receiving the approval from repository owner else will label the hosting request issue as *Not Approved* 
   5.  On a successful hosting, the hosting team will add the link of the newly hosted content to the hosting request issue. They will also label the issue as *Hosted*.
   6.  However, on failure ( because of missing or incorrect information or repository problems,), the hosting team will label the issue as *Failed*.
   7.  The requester will be responsible for fixing the failed hosting bug and will need to raise a new '[hosting request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose)' to get the unit hosted.
   8.  Once the hosting is successful, the requester will be responsible for the verification of the hosted link.  If the hosting is not as expected, the requester should change the label from *Hosted* to *Reopened*. The requester will also need to specify if he/she would like to revert to the previous hosted image.
   9.  An issue with *Reopened* label will by default host the repository and branch/tag as specified in the hosting request initially. However, if the requester has specifically requested a revert, the previously hosted image will be restored and issue will be labelled as *Reverted*.
   10.  If the requester wants to revert to any earlier branch/tag, a new '[hosting request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose)' will need to be raised to get the unit hosted.
   11. Requester will be responsible for closing a hosting request issue by changing the issue status from Open to Closed when the issue is labelled as *Hosted* or *Reopened* or *Reverted* or *Not Approved*.

### Labels & Status of a Hosting Request 

   At any given time a hosting issue should be marked with only one of the following labels. To change the label of an issue, the current label of the issue should be unchecked and the new label should be checked.

   *Hosted* :  This label indicates that the hosting request has been successful and the hosted url has been shared in the hosting request issue. This label is used only by the hosting team. 
   
   *Failed* : This label indicates that the hosting request has not been successful. This label is used only by the hosting team.

   *Reopened* : This label is used by the requester to indicate that the hosting url provided on a successful hosting of the hosting unit is not passing the validation.
   
   *Not Approved* : This label indicates that the hosting request issue raised by the requester was not approved by the Repository Owner.  This label is used only by the hosting team.
    
   *Reverted* :  This label indicates that the hosting request has been successfully revert to the previous hosted image. This label is used only by the hosting team. 
    
   Apart from the above mentioned labels a hosting request issue can either be in a closed or open status as provided by GitHub. 

   *Open* : This status indicates that a new hosting request issue has been raised and is waiting for the services of the hosting team. All issues are in this status when they are created on GitHub.

   *Closed* : This status indicates that a hosting request has been serviced by the hosting team and is labelled as *Hosted* or *Reopened* or *Reverted* or *Not Approved*.


## Process to be followed for creating of Experiment Repositories


   Steps to be followed by VLEAD's Hosting Engineer


   - Step 1 : </br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On receiving a [request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues) for creation of experiment repositories for the lab, VLEAD's hosting engineer will create the experiment(s) repository from the [ph3-exp-template](https://github.com/virtual-labs/ph3-exp-template) repository.
               
   - Step 2 : </br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VLEAD's hosting engineer will create two branches - dev and testing from the main branch in the created experiment repositories.
              
              
   - Step 3 : </br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VLEAD's hosting engineer will add the Github Handle of the experiment developer provided in the request issue to the newly created experiment repository with maintainer access. VLEAD's hosting engineer will also add developerâ€™s common email address to github notification center.

   - Step 4 : </br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VLEAD's hosting engineer will comment on the repository creation request providing the links to the created repositories. 


## Process to be followed for OnBoarding Request 

VLEAD and IITB will follow the process detailed below for the hosting of labs which have been developed with each experiment having its own repository. All the Phase 3 labs and experiments hosted on AWS will have a common UI  and report analytics at both lab and experiment level. 

  - Step 1 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIITH will create lab repo for the lab that is ready ( marked in green) in the 200224_Deliverable_Status_Phase3 sheet shared by IITB and also populate the lab urls in the sheet.

  - Step 2 :
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IITB will raise an issue of type Phase 3 Onboarding [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][Request]] and fill the lab name and lab url ( as populated in the excel sheet by IIITH) and attach the R0 of the lab.

  - Step 3 :
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIITH will tag the head of the master branch of all the experiments in that lab as mentioned in the 200224_Deliverable_Status_Phase3 as v1.0.0

  - Step 4 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIITH will populate the received Phase 3 Onboarding  [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][Request]] with experiment details ( name, url, tag, branch and build command) and Owner details and request for approval from IITB . It will be assumed by IIITH that no special hardware or software is required for the running of the experiments.  IITB will have to specially state if this is not the case.

  - Step 5 :
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IITB will validate the above data and approve the same on the received Phase 3 Onboarding [Request](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose) .

  - Step 6 :
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On approval from IITB , IIITH will host all the experiments and populate the lab landing page information (Introduction, Objective, List of experiments, target audience, course alignment ) from the R0 shared by IITB in the Phase 3 Onboarding [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues/new/choose][Request]].

  - Step 7 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIITH will host the lab and share the hosted url link as part of the onboarding request issue and seek approval from the github handle of the owner of the lab ( as recorded in the onboarding request)

  - Step 8 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On approval from the Lab owner, IIITH will share the link with IIT Delhi.

### Rehosting Process for Phase III Lab 

   VLEAD and the institute requesting the rehosting of Phase
   3 lab while changing the content of the lab will follow
   the process detailed below- 
   

  - Step 1 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institute requesting rehosting will follow the [link](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues) and locate the Phase III Lab/Experiment(s) OnBoarding Request issue corresponding to the lab that they  wish to rehost.

  - Step 2 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will comment on the issue with the content that they like to add to the lab pages following the format - Lab Section Name - New content

  - Step 3 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VLEAD's hosting engineer will host the lab with the requested changes and share the link on the same issue to seek approval from institute requesting rehosting. 

  - Step 4 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institute requesting rehosting will need to test the hosted link and on their approval the hosted link will be shared with IITD (to be added to vlab.co.in).

### Rehosting Process for Phase III Experiments 
   
   VLEAD and the institute requesting the rehosting of Phase 3 lab after changing the content of experiment will follow the process detailed below-

  - Step 1  :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institute requesting rehosting will make the necessary changes to the experiment content in the experiment repository on GitLab ( IITB server ) or Github (virtual-labs organization) as per the process followed during experiment development.  After they make the changes to the experiment sources , they will need to tag it.

  - Step 2 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then will then follow the [link](https://github.com/virtual-labs/engineers-forum/issues) and locate the Phase III Lab/Experiment(s) OnBoarding Request issue corresponding to the lab containing the experiment that they wish to rehost.

  - Step 3 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will comment on the same Phase III Lab/Experiment(s) OnBoarding Request with the following text "Request to rehost the experiment <exp repo link> with the tag <tag number>".  They  may include more than one experiment ( belonging to the same lab) rehosting request at a time.

  - Step 4 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VLEAD's hosting engineer will host the experiments and share the link on the same issue to seek approval from them.

  - Step 5 :
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institute requesting rehosting will need to test the hosted link and comment on the same issue stating their approval.
